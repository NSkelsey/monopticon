### Backlog
========================================

#### Conn-event framework
- [ ] Arbitrary zeek: conn based event framework.
    - Components:
        - stream event to graphics process
        - imgui window
        - this class:
```c++
        class EventWatcher {
            string name // doubles as channel name
            Vec3 color
            Vector <Events> {
                A, B // l3 device references
                new_drawables // line; bbdrawable
                int t // parameter
            }
        }
```

    - (zeek) side:
        (on startup) - to start use programmed list
            - load needed plugins
            - (open - listening channel)
        (on signal) write into brokered `monopt/event_name`:

    - custom zeek-script
        - `redef EventVizList += { "custom_event_name" };
        - `EventMap::EventTable["custom_event_name"] = custom_event;`

    - (streaming graphic):
        - `map<str, EventW> _active_event_subscriptions`
        - reads from currently watched "event_name":
        - lookup and find L3 addresses:
            - create `Event` add to `EventWatcher.events`
                - add L3 device effect (highlighted red)
                - draw a curve and set t
        - in `draw`
            - decrement t
        - check `EventWatcher` remove `Events` and their drawables

    - (peer_connected):
        - open `monopt/event_subscriber`
        - build "EventWatcher" from communicated list.

    - IMGUI widget:
        - [Pick event >]
            [ x icmp-ping ] [ color ]
            [ o ssh-auth-init ] [ color ]
            [ o dhcp-bind ] [ color ]
        - in `drawImGUI()`
        - create `EventWatcher`; write name into `event_subscriber`


- [ ] Add Strict Ordering:
    - [x] figure out how to generate raw packet events from pcaps
        - Use tcpreplay to resend packets on some net interface
    - [ ] determine how the timeline works
    - [ ] slow down time to step through packet interactions

- [ ] Improve layout:
    - [ ] Add list of known positions for known devices
    - maybe implement a Radial Balloon Tree with groups based on MACs (bcast, gway, trusted, unknown)

- [ ] Improve analysis
    - [ ] Use find routers script to add subnets
    - [ ] add colors for ARP req/resp
        - figure out how to filter to deduplicate arp from raw packets
    - [ ] parse dhcp to intuit network topology
    - [x] group broadcast and multicast domains
    - [ ] try to reconstruct arp table of devices inside of the broadcast domain.

- [ ] Add packet filtering
    - Create a status_subscriber to monitor the broker conn: [zeek docs](https://bro-broker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/comm.html#status-and-error-messages)
    - analyze BPF syntax and zeek configuration - exclude filters via zeek module
    - add ui elements (text bar, minimal lookback)
    - apply filters

- [ ] Improve Scaling
    - [x] Dies at 65355 "too large scene" Corrade assert // handled with hardcoded limit for now
    - Produce summary inside of zeek script that remains constant size
    - Use different levels of detail:
        - Every packet
        - Medium (connections)
        - High (summarizes of connections)

- [ ] Improve Logging
    - [x] Broker does not log well (compile time options)
    - [ ] Use log levels inside of monopticon
        - [ ] configurable with a command line flag

- [ ] Expirements to attempt:
    - [ ] Timeline (with sliding window of pcap)
    - [x] Port Manifold Shader and Setup:
    See `expirements/port-manifold`

- [ ] Improve Portability v2:
    - [ ] Package application in .deb

- [ ] Make more bello:
    - [ ] Traffic graphs should zero out or continue sliding after disconnect
    - [ ] Add a skybox that simulates __cyberspace__
    - [ ] Add sounds for specific events for __cyberspace__
    - [ ] Create a flat band mesh instead of single pix width wireframes
    - [ ] Add Oscope like persistence to transmissions for __tron__ **Special FX**
    - [ ] Use a drop down menu to select the statistic to graph in the ifaceMgrCharts

- [ ] Create extensible object manipulation API
    - [ ] Add an API (type for records to be included in epoch event)
      possibily use a generic format like:
```
Create thing:
  [$type, $mac]
Destroy thing:
Update thing:
Do Thing:
  [$effect: enum, $window_content: string, $color: uint, $things: string, $dst: string]
```

DONE
====
- [x] Improve layout:
    - [x] fix label overlap
    - [x] demo circle layout that expands
    - [x] Demo 3D cube layouts

- [x] Add IP routes and labels to L2Devices:
    - [x] Use an enter `Thing Record` associated to the L2Device
    - Issue updates for inferred arp table routes to the `Thing Record`:
      the epoch_arp_table updates here are the new additions to the device tables
    - [x] Labels are going to be there own entity inside of the visualization.
      - [x] Level3 - Address Class
      - [x] Placed Above first discovered MAC address with IP.

- [x] Bugfix text renderer assertion failure
    - [x] issue might be garbage the values passed from monopt_proto_iface (just print the output ~ this worked)
    - [no luck] use gef to hook the failure, hard to reach and trigger, could be a non initialized value within object

- [x] Delete everthing on disconnect to reduce confusion.
    - its distracting
    - escalated to gitter
    - escalated to valgrind which finds __no memory leaks__ (only definite ones...)
        - libSDL.so leaks and usr/lib//dri/i965 as well
    - To do again:
```zsh
# Generate suppression output
> valgrind --suppressions=minimal.supp --track-origins=no --leak-check=yes --show-leak-kinds=definite --gen-suppressions=all --log-file=minimalraw.log ./bin/monopticon 2> out-with-suppressions.txt
# parse it
> cat minimalraw.log | ./parse_valgrind.sh > minimal.supp
# Use it too analyze changes or interesting poitns
> valgrind --suppressions=minimal.supp --track-origins=no --leak-check=yes --show-leak-kinds=definite ./bin/monopticon
```

- [x] Improve Navigation
    - [x] Zooming (stashed...)
        - understand why cameraRig transformation produce crazy results: it was a local transform issue
    - [x] Move camera to orbit other points: abrupt, but it works well enough for now.
    - [x] Clamp zoom based on distance from the local rotation point

- [x] Reduce framebuffer copying and handle MSAA properly.

- [x] Structural/design for sampling at intervals:
    - Refactor to sending epoch messages at 240Hz (TBD) where:
        - Every message contains all of the information neccessary to visualizeall captured events that occured within that interval.
        - The draw loop processes some number of epoch steps every frame: adding, moving and removing objects in the scene
        - The amount of state stored within the main process is minimized in favor of management within zeek.

    - Tasks:
        - [x] Test scheduling and intervals with zeek at sub second frequencies
        - [x] Test windowing and SumStats to track state across windows with zeek
        - [x] List all possible information collected for types sent to monopticon
            - new device
            - new router
            - packet `(l2type, mac_src, mac_dst, ip_src, ip_dst, size)`
            - (api request) inferred ARP tables
        - [x] Refactor `processNetEvents()` to handle messaging format
            - [x] empircally measure arrival frequency
    Note: For large simple traffic flows between two hosts this optimization handles the load well.
          Instead for large amounts of traffic flow coming to and from large numbers of devices, the
          app still experiences large fps drops. Further investigation is needed as well as a good
          measurement framework
    Soln: Disabling --debug inside of the zeek-broker and switching to sampling when event processing
           speeds drop keeps performance around 18ms at 4500 packets per second (nmap -T5 /24 + noise)

    - [x] figure out how to force zeek_init instead of the deprecated bro_init
    - [x] internal: ask for a strace of execution
    - [x] plan binary distribution via static build (not possible)
          - [x] ensure that the script file is installed on the system

- [x] Release source
    - Split files from single source file
    - Add version

- [x] Test Portability:
